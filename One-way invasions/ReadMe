These mathematica files of One way invasions show every mutant strategy invading every other parental care strategy against different life history rates. 
The files are organised by which life history rate is the independent variable. 
Z0 is benefits of care along the x axis varying in the mutant and the resident simultaneously, z is the mutant benefits of care varying independently of the fixed equilibrium strategy with static benefits of care (usually 1).
