These mathematica files of One way invasions show every mutant strategy invading every other parental care strategy against different life history rates. 
The files are organised by which life history rate is the independent variable. 
Z0 is benefits of care along the x axis varying in the mutant and the resident simultaneously, z is the mutant benefits of care varying independently of the fixed equilibrium strategy with static benefits of care (usually 1).
The shape of the fitness against level of care graphs (c_m, c_f) change with changing the value of z0. Increasing z0 gives graphs with a clear fitness peak followed by a dip.
